abstract = {Blockchain has been said to be one of the technologies for the future, and researchers have argued that this technology is going to disrupt many industries in the coming years, and democratic elections are one of the key areas blockchain is going to transform. Several organizations have begun experimenting on blockchain-enabled e-voting platforms, such as Democratic Earth, Horizon State and Follow My Vote. This study seeks to conceptualize a blockchain architecture for the storage of election results that provide trust, transparency, and immutability using distributed ledger technology (DLT). One of the main issues with elections in Ghana and other sub-Saharan African countries is the inaccurate recording of votes from polling stations, constituencies and at the national office. There are instances where votes recorded at the polling station changes at the constituencies either intentionally or accidentally. The study discussed the basic properties of the blockchain, such as distributed ledger, consensus mechanisms and cryptographic hash function, and how it can be used to address the current challenges in vote recording during elections. The study evaluates current blockchain-enabled e-voting systems and designs a blockchain-based vote recording system that provides immutability, trust, and transparency. The proposed design addresses the issues of vote tempering because transactions added to the block are secure with a cryptographic hash function which makes tempering of the votes stored in the blockchain nearly impossible and make it immutable.},

abstract = {Multiple serious vulnerabilities were detected during the last Public Security Tests of the Brazilian voting system. When combined, they allowed to compromise the main security properties of the system, namely ballot secrecy and software integrity. The insecure storage of cryptographic keys, hard-coded directly in source code and shared among all machines, allowed full content inspection of the software installation memory cards, after which two shared libraries missing authentication signatures were detected. Injecting code in those libraries opened the possibility of having complete control over the machine. As far as we know, this was the most in-depth exploitation of an official large-scale voting system ever performed during severely restricted tests. Resumo.

	abstract = {We compare the behavior of voters under simultaneous and sequential voting rules when voting is costly and information is incomplete. In many political institutions, ranging from small committees to mass elections, voting is sequential, which allows some voters to know the choices of earlier voters. For a stylized model, we generate a variety of predictions about the relative efficiency and participation equity of these two systems, which we test using controlled laboratory experiments. Most of the qualitative predictions are supported by the data, but there are significant departures from the predicted equilibrium strategies, in both the sequential and the simultaneous voting games. We find a tradeoff between information aggregation, efficiency, and equity in sequential voting: a sequential voting rule aggregates information better than simultaneous voting and is more efficient in some information environments, but sequential voting is inequitable because early voters bear more participation costs.},

@article{Onik2019,
abstract = {Secure data distribution is critical for data accountability. Surveillance caused privacy breaching incidents have already questioned existing personal data collection techniques. Organizations assemble a huge amount of personally identifiable information (PII) for data-driven market analysis and prediction. However, the limitation of data tracking tools restricts the detection of exact data breaching points. Blockchain technology, an ‘immutable' distributed ledger, can be leveraged to establish a transparent data auditing platform. However, Art. 42 and Art. 25 of general data protection regulation (GDPR) demands ‘right to forget' and ‘right to erase' of personal information, which goes against the immutability of blockchain technology. This paper proposes a GDPR complied decentralized and trusted PII sharing and tracking scheme. Proposed blockchain based personally identifiable information management system (BcPIIMS) demonstrates data movement among GDPR entities (user, controller and processor). Considering GDPR limitations, BcPIIMS used off-the-chain data storing architecture. A prototype was created to validate the proposed architecture using multichain. The use of off-the-chain storage reduces individual block size. Additionally, private blockchain also limits personal data leaking by collecting fast approval from restricted peers. This study presents personal data sharing, deleting, modifying and tracking features to verify the privacy of proposed blockchain based personally identifiable information management system.},

Five years on, this paper captures in one place the various applications, improvements suggested and related subsequent publications, and describes initial experience from experiments using hashcash. The hashcash CPU cost-function computes a token which can be used as a proof-of-work. Interactive and non-interactive variants of cost-functions can be constructed which can be used in situations where the server can issue a challenge (connection oriented interactive protocol), and where it can not (where the communication is store-and-forward, or packet oriented) respectively.},

	abstract = {Blockchain is cutting-edge technology and it has been gaining popularity for cryptocurrency and financial transactions. The transaction process is maintained by the blockchain, which can be used to verify the reliability of the transactional contract. The main effort in this study is the significant accessibility of block-chain based on other technologies including the electronic voting (e-voting) system. In particular, the traditional e-voting system has various limitations and challenges for a very long time. For building a secure e-voting system we have proposed a blockchain-based distributed application that offers fairness, transparency, and flexibility than the existing system. The paper presents a novel secured distributed database of the voter's information, and voter information will be deposited against their private key and digital signature in the central database. Finally, the block-chain based application allows solid robustness, privacy, and transparency which improves the system reliability, secure and reductions the expenditure of hosting a countrywide election.},

	abstract = {We propose a decentralised end-to-end voting platform (from voter to candidate) based on the block-chain technology. In particular, we study and exploit both the non-permissioned ledger of Bitcoin, and the MultiChain permissioned ledger. We describe the main architectural choices behind the two implementations, including the pre-voting and post-voting phases. Similar approaches are not as decentralised as our application, where it is possible to directly cast a vote to the block-chain, without any intermediate level. Benefits and drawbacks of each implementation are explained. The Bitcoin block-chain consists in a large number of already available nodes in the related peer-to-peer network; moreover, its reliability and resistance to attacks are also well established. With MultiChain we instead exploit a fine-grained permission system: MultiChain is a permissioned public ledger. Hence, with it we can also satisfy two more properties of end-to-end voting systems: uncoercibility and receipt-freeness and data confidentiality and neutrality. Moreover, we can avoid costs and price fluctuations related to Bitcoin.},

	abstract = {Electronic voting (e-voting) is an electronic means for casting and counting votes. It is an efficient and cost-effective way for conducting a voting procedure, which has characteristic of being magnanimous data and real time and requesting high safety. However, concerns on security of networking and privacy of communication for e-voting have been grown. Securing e-voting is very urgent and has becoming a popular topic in the area of communications and networking. We present techniques to exploit blockchain in P2P network to improve the security of e-voting. First, we design a synchronized model of voting records based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) to avoid forgery of votes. Second, we design a user credential model based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to provide authentication and non-repudiation. Third, we design a withdrawal model that allows voters to change their vote before a preset deadline. By integrating the above designs, a blockchain-based e-voting scheme in P2P network is proposed for essential requirements of e-voting process. To prove and verify the scheme, a blockchain-based e-voting system for multiple candidates has been designed on Linux platforms in P2P network. The system involves electronic voting theory, cryptography, and software engineering theory. The implementation result shows that it is a practical and secure e-voting system, which solves the problem on forgery of votes during e-voting. The blockchain-based e-voting system can be applied to a variety of networking applications directly.},
